# Python-Password-Generator-v2

# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to follow up on some skills that i obtained about OOP in python class in college. Since i learned how to
write classes last quarter in school, i wanted to take a second look at a project i learned how to do early on as a coder, but only this time around rather than write 
a simple script. I wanted to see, what it would take to build the same project only this time declaring it as an object in python.

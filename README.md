# Python-Password-Generator-v2

# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to follow up on some skills that i obtained about OOP in python class in college. Since i learned how to
write classes, i wanted to take a second look at a project i learned how to do early on as a coder but this time around rather than write 
a simple script i wanted to see what it would take to build the same project only this time declaring an Object and writing it in python 
as a class because classes are objects in python. Now with the project intro out of the way, i would like to dive into how i created a 
simple password generator using classes. To declare my password generator class i had to create two things first. The first being the class
name and second the instance that callsback to your class. In my code example you can see, that i declared my object/class by typing 
class PasswordGenerator: essentially what this does at this time of the code is that it just assigns a name my object/class. I can't really 
do anything until i've callback to the object/class. The method i used to callback to my object/class was by creating an instance of the class
and the way i did that was to create a super random but pretty justifiable variable called pg which is short for password generator and 
we gave it the value of the object class
